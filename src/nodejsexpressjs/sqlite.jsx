            <p>SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, 
                high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine.</p>
            <p>SQLite is the most widely deployed database engine in the world. 
                It is used in mobile phones, tablets, and other embedded devices, as well 
                as in desktop applications and web browsers.</p>
            <p>SQLite is a serverless, self-contained, zero-configuration, transactional 
                SQL database engine. It is the most widely used database engine in the world, 
                and it is the default database engine for many programming languages, 
                including Python, Ruby, and PHP.</p>
            <p>SQLite is a great choice for small to medium-sized applications, and it is often used 
                as a lightweight alternative to larger database systems like MySQL and PostgreSQL.</p>
